# DO NOT RUN THIS CODE IF YOU DOT HAVE A RELIABLE WAY TO STOP IT

- I made for my own play through, so I just know that it works on my machine
- every time that de program closes it self it saves the current number to mem.txt it also starts from there if you run it again
- if you find a fax number the number is saved to mem.txt (it will be a little higher than the actual fax number found)
